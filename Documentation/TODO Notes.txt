TODO / SUGGESTIONS

======= Structure
* Simplify file names: eg methods_MODEL2HDM --> methods

===== Symbols/params =====
* Change params from a list to a dict?


===== Methods =====
* Automate the CT-potential variables? (special function for this?)
eg see BSMPT eq 2.25
* Fix so that input in multiprocess gets aborted when process is finished


==============
* Use PyQt5.QtWidget for desktop app?
see: https://github.com/phbasler/BSMPT/blob/master/src/models/ClassPotentialOrigin.cpp#L1403
